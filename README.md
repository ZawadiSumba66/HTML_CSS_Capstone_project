# HTML_CSS_Capstone_project

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microverse-blueviolet)

This my  final project in the HTML/CSS  module at Microverse. In it, I have showcased bootstrap.

The project is a hotel web app that entails the services offered, location of the hotel in different parts of the country and other UX designs. The app focuses on giving clients an easier time to book for various facilities the hotel offers

The website is fully responsive with the help of three `media query` `breakpoints` (the default being the smaller viewport), namely: `< 768px`, `>= 768px`, `>= 1024px`, `>= 1280px`.
